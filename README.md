# RadiOS

RadiOS is an iOS app developed for a last-year university project.

The goal is to be able to add and listen to different radio flows using their links, and grouping them in categories.

The radios are saved in a local SQLite database stored in the app data. It comes initialized with a couple of default radios.

- Xcode version used:     16.1 (16B40)
